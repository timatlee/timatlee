ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @timatlee

I'm a system administrator at an SMB in energy research and engineering.

I'm intersted in systems monitoring and management tools, use of devops strategies to improve efficiency and practices that make help deliver improved systems and networks to internal clients, so they can be more effective.

I'm interested in PowerShell, Go, static site generators and a handful of other things.
